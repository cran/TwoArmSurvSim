Description: A system to simulate clinical trials with time to event endpoints. Event simulation is based on Cox models allowing for covariates in addition to the treatment or group factor. Specific drop-out rates (separate from administrative censoring) can be controlled in the simulation. Other features include stratified randomization, non-proportional hazards, different accrual patterns, and event projection (timing to reach the target event) based on interim data.
